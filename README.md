## Project Overview  
In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.  
> Assignment prompt is found in [Module_19_Challenge.pdf](/Module_19_Challenge.pdf).  

## The Process  
1. **Preparing the data:** We were given cryptocurrency market data in a csv file documenting price change percentage over time. The data was scaled using the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn.

2. **Finding the best value for k (scaled data):** used the elbow method to find the best k value, which was 4.

3. **Clustering cryptocurrencies with K-means (scaled data):** predicted segments using the K-means model. Created a scatter plot showing price percent changes from 24 hours and 7days columns and colored the plots by the predicted cryptocurrency clusters.

4. **Optimizing clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Performed a PCA and reduced the scaled data to 3 features (PC1, PC2, PC3).

The total explained variance of the three PCs were:  
    - PC1: 0.3719856
    - PC2: 0.34700813
    - PC3: 0.17603793
    - Total: 0.8950316570309841  

5. **Finding the best value for k (PCA data):** the best k value was 4, the same as with the scaled data.

6. **Clustering cryptocurrencies with K-means (PCA):** predicted cryptocurrency clusters using K-means model based on the PCA data this time instead of the scaled data. The scatter plot shows PC1 vs PC2 and the colors represent their segments.

Although this was not required, I also plotted PC1 vs PC3 and PC2 vs PC3 just out of curiosity.

7. **Visualized and compared the results:** compared the elbow curves and the scatter plots side by side to compare the data with and without PCA. In the below graph, the blue line is the elbow curve of the scaled data and the red line is the elbow curve of the data after PCA reduction.

Here is an image of the scaled data clusters on the left and the PCA data clusters on the right.

8. **Conclusion question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?  
  * **Answer:** By using fewer features via PCA, the scatter plot appears more simplified (less noisy), making it easier to visually differentiate the segments. Rather than trying to visualize the relationships between all the price change intervals (24h, 7d, 14d, 30d, etc.), it is easier to deal with just 3 features (PC1, PC2, PC3). However, the disadvange of using fewer features is that there is a loss of information regarding the variables that are contributing to the clustering. In this case, there was a loss of about 10.5% (total variance calculation showed 89.5%).
